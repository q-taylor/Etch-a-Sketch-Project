Etch-a-Sketch on a webpage

Allows the user to change the size of the gridding in the space of 960px x 960px up to 100 x 100

Through this exercise I will learn about:
 -the different methods to create a grid in css
 -using button tags and running javascript from a button





Plan:
build loop in javascript that creates a grid (default 16 x 16) using div elements
 -put inside container div
